    <p>Welcome to the rehearsal tool! This page allows actors to easily highlight their lines in the play by clicking on their character's name. When an actor clicks on their name, all their lines will be highlighted, making it easier to rehearse. Any other lines from different actors will be un-highlighted. This tool can accommodate multiple actors and scenes, and the changes happen instantly, without page reloads.
        Below is a passage from the play ‘A Streetcar Named Desire’ by Tennessee Williams. Click on the different lines to see how the page functions.</p>
    <div id= "play">
        <p><span data-actor="Stella"> Stella: Well, Blanche, what do you think of the place?</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="Blanche"> Blanche: Oh, it's... charming, in its own way. Cozy. But I must say, I’m a little shocked at how small it is. I always imagined that New Orleans would be a bit more... grand.</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="Stanley"> Stanley: We’re working-class folk here, Blanche. You might be used to the big houses back home, but this is home for us.</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="Blanche"> Blanche: Oh, I didn’t mean anything by it, Stanley. I just meant... well, it’s not what I expected. But that’s alright, I’m sure it’s full of... character.</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="Stella"> Stella: It’s comfortable. It’s got everything we need.</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="Blanche"> Blanche: Well, I’m sure it’s perfect for you, Stella. You’ve always made the best of things. You always knew how to make your way in the world.</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="Stanley"> Stanley: She sure does. My Stella’s the best.</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="Blanche"> Blanche: She certainly is... a woman of strength.</span></p>
